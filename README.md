# Testing Practice
This project was created for The Odin Project's [Testing JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) section. It was an opportunity to practice writing tests for five different functions and getting those tests to pass.
<br/><br/>
The functions were written in JavaScript and were tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
